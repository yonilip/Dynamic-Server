Dynamic Server written for the Internet Technologies course in
The Hebrew University, 2015 - 2016.

Written on NodeJs, emulating the Express framework using their API and the
simple net framework.

It contains everything from a parser, to the event handler modules.

Thus, all the huji prefixes are acronyms to "hebrew university jerusalem israel".
